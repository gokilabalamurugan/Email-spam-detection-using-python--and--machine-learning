# Email-spam-detection-using-python--and--machine-learning
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using python and ML techniques. The dataset is cleaned,pre-processed,and transformed using TF-IDF vectorization. Multiple algorithms like naive bayes and SVM were tested,and the best model was selected based on accuracy. A simple GUI was created to allow users to check if an email is spam.
